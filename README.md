In the project directory, before you run, you must check if you have installed:
- mongodb (installed and running on host: 'mongodb://127.0.0.1/pawego_todos_api_db')
- nodejs (minimal version: 16.x.x)
- nice to have nodejs packages installed globally: nodemon 

After check, you can run app from this commnand:

### `node index.js` 
or if you have nodemon
### `nodemon index.js`
